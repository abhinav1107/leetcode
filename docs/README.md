### What is it for
I have always wanted to solve [Leetcode Problems](https://leetcode.com/problemset/).

One would think I do/did this for interview preparation, which couldn't be any more wrong. Rather I am doing this to make my algorithm game a little stronger.

I would like to think that this exercise will overall improve my DevOps skills as well. Only time will tell.
